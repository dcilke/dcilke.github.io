# Privacy Policy for Once More

**Effective Date**: 2025-09-30
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-30

## Introduction

Once More ("we," "our," or "the app") is a menstrual cycle tracking application designed to help you track and manage your cycle with privacy and simplicity. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide Directly

When you use Once More, you may provide the following information:

- **Cycle Data**: Start and end dates of your menstrual cycles
- **Profile Information**: Profile names you create within the app (e.g., "My Cycle")
- **Notification Preferences**: Your preferences for cycle reminders and notifications
- **Symptom Information**: Optional symptom logs you choose to record

### Automatically Collected Information

- **Device Information**: We collect limited device information necessary for iCloud sync functionality (device identifiers for CloudKit)
- **Usage Data**: The app stores local preferences using UserDefaults (e.g., whether you've completed initial setup)

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect only to provide and improve the app's functionality:

- **Cycle Tracking**: To record and display your menstrual cycle history
- **Predictions**: To calculate average cycle lengths and predict future cycle dates
- **Notifications**: To send you friendly reminders based on your preferences
- **iCloud Sync**: To sync your data across your Apple devices using CloudKit

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage

All your cycle data is stored locally on your device using Core Data, Apple's secure data persistence framework. Your data remains on your device unless you choose to enable iCloud sync.

### iCloud Sync

If you're signed in to iCloud, your cycle data is automatically synced across your devices using Apple's CloudKit service:

- Data is stored in your **private CloudKit database**, accessible only by you
- All data transmission is encrypted in transit using Apple's secure infrastructure
- We never have access to your CloudKit data - it's stored entirely within your iCloud account
- You can disable iCloud sync by turning off iCloud for Once More in your device settings

### Security Measures

- No data is transmitted to third-party servers
- No analytics or tracking services are used
- No personally identifiable information is collected beyond what you choose to enter
- All data remains under your control

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

**We do not share, sell, or transfer your data to any third parties.** Your information stays on your device and in your private iCloud account.

### No Third-Party Services

Once More does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The only external service used is Apple's CloudKit, which is part of your iCloud account.

## Your Rights and Choices

You have complete control over your data:

### Access and Export

Currently, Once More stores all data locally on your device. You can view all your cycle history within the app. Data export functionality is planned for a future update.

### Data Deletion

You can delete your data at any time:

- **Delete Individual Cycles**: Swipe to delete specific cycle records
- **Delete Profiles**: Remove individual profiles and all associated data
- **Complete Data Deletion**: Use the "Wipe All Data" feature in Settings (if enabled) to permanently delete all app data

Note: Deleting data from the app will also remove it from iCloud if sync is enabled. This action cannot be undone.

### iCloud Sync Control

You can control iCloud sync:
- Go to iOS Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → Once More
- Toggle off to disable sync and keep data only on your device

## Children's Privacy

Once More is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

The app's age rating is set to 12+ due to its health and menstrual cycle content, which is appropriate for adolescents beginning menstruation. Parental guidance is recommended for users under 13.

## Medical Disclaimer

**Once More is for informational and tracking purposes only.** The app is not intended to:

- Diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any medical condition
- Provide medical advice or replace professional healthcare
- Be used as a birth control or fertility planning method

Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. If you have concerns about your menstrual health, please contact your doctor.

## Notifications

If you enable notifications, Once More will send you reminders based on your cycle predictions and preferences:

- Notifications are generated locally on your device
- No data is transmitted to external servers to generate notifications
- You can modify or disable notifications at any time in Settings
- You must grant permission for notifications when first requested

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any material changes by:

- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy
- Displaying a notice in the app (for significant changes)

Your continued use of Once More after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.

## Data Retention

- **Active Data**: Your cycle data is retained in the app until you choose to delete it
- **Deleted Data**: When you delete cycles or profiles, they are permanently removed from your device and iCloud (if sync is enabled)
- **App Deletion**: If you uninstall Once More, all locally stored data is removed from your device. iCloud data may remain in your CloudKit storage unless manually deleted.

## International Users

Once More is available worldwide. Your data is stored on your device and in your iCloud account, which may be located in various data centers globally based on your Apple ID region. Apple's [iCloud Terms and Conditions](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/) govern the storage location and handling of iCloud data.
